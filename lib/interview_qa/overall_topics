💡 Interview Mein Bolne Ka Style:
Sir, Flutter mein animations ko hum do parts mein divide karte hain: implicit (simple) aur explicit (controlled).
UI enhancement ke liye hum shimmer, custom transitions, Hero animation, and packages like Lottie and flutter_animate use karte hain.
Proper responsive and adaptive layout ke sath animation ka combination real app ko pro look deta hai.
